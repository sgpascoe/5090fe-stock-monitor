ANDROID UNIGNORABLE ALERT SETUP
================================

For MAXIMUM unignorable alerts on Android, set up these methods:

1. PUSHOVER (BEST - £4.99 one-time, bypasses DND)
   ------------------------------------------------
   a) Download Pushover app from Google Play Store
   b) Create account at pushover.net
   c) Get your User Key from pushover.net
   d) Create an application at pushover.net to get API Token
   e) In Pushover app → Settings → Notifications:
      - Emergency Priority: ON (this bypasses DND!)
      - Sound: Persistent (loudest)
      - Vibration: Maximum
      - Override Do Not Disturb: ON
   f) Add to GitHub Secrets:
      - PUSHOVER_TOKEN = your API token
      - PUSHOVER_USER = your user key

   The script sends Emergency Priority (priority 2) which:
   - Bypasses Do Not Disturb
   - Repeats every 30 seconds until you acknowledge
   - Plays sound even on silent mode
   - Vibrates continuously

2. IFTTT PHONE CALL (MOST UNIGNORABLE - FREE)
   -------------------------------------------
   a) Go to ifttt.com and create account
   b) Create new Applet:
      - IF: Webhooks → Receive a webhook event
        Event Name: rtx5090_in_stock
      - THEN: Phone Call → Call my phone
        Message: "RTX 5090 is in stock! Check your phone now!"
   c) Get your IFTTT key from: https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks
   d) Add to GitHub Secrets:
      - IFTTT_KEY = your webhook key
      - IFTTT_EVENT = rtx5090_in_stock

   This will CALL YOUR PHONE when stock is detected!

3. TELEGRAM (FREE - Good backup)
   -------------------------------
   a) Create bot with @BotFather on Telegram
   b) Get your chat ID (message @userinfobot)
   c) In Telegram app → Settings → Notifications:
      - Override Do Not Disturb: ON
      - Sound: Custom loud alarm
      - Vibration: Strong
      - Pop on screen: ON
      - High priority: ON
   d) Add to GitHub Secrets:
      - TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = your bot token
      - TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = your chat ID

   The script sends 3 rapid messages for maximum alert!

4. COMBINE ALL THREE FOR MAXIMUM ALERT
   -------------------------------------
   Use Pushover + IFTTT Phone Call + Telegram together.
   When stock is detected, you'll get:
   - Pushover emergency notification (repeats every 30s)
   - Phone call from IFTTT
   - 3 Telegram messages
   - Discord alert (if configured)

TEST YOUR SETUP:
----------------
Run locally to test:
  python test_notifications.py

Or trigger GitHub Actions manually to test:
  Go to Actions tab → Run workflow

IMPORTANT ANDROID SETTINGS:
---------------------------
For each app (Pushover, Telegram):
1. Settings → Apps → [App Name] → Notifications
2. Enable "Override Do Not Disturb"
3. Set notification importance to "Urgent" or "High"
4. Enable sound and vibration
5. Disable battery optimization for the app

This ensures alerts work even when phone is sleeping!
