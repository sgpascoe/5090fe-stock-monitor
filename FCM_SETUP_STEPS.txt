FCM SETUP - STEP BY STEP GUIDE
===============================

You're currently on the Android app registration screen. Here's what to do:

STEP 1: Complete Android App Registration (You're here!)
---------------------------------------------------------
On the screen you see:
- "Download and then add config file"
- "Add Firebase SDK"
- "Next steps"

1. Click "Download google-services.json"
   - This downloads a file you'll need for the Android app
   - Save it somewhere (you'll use it when building the Android app)

2. Click "Next" to continue through the setup
   - You can skip the "Add Firebase SDK" step for now
   - We'll add that when building the Android app

STEP 2: Get Server Key (After app registration)
------------------------------------------------
Once you've completed the Android app registration:

1. Look at the LEFT SIDEBAR in Firebase Console
2. Click the GEAR ICON ⚙️ next to "Project Overview"
   - It's at the top of the left sidebar
   - Or click "Project Settings" text

3. In Project Settings:
   - Click the "Cloud Messaging" tab at the top
   - You'll see "Server key" - COPY THIS
   - This is your FCM_SERVER_KEY

STEP 3: Alternative Way to Get Server Key
------------------------------------------
If you can't find the gear icon:

1. Look at the top navigation bar
2. Click "Project Settings" (text link, not icon)
3. Or go directly to:
   https://console.firebase.google.com/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/settings/cloudmessaging
   (Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your actual project ID)

STEP 4: Get Device Token
-------------------------
After you have the Server Key:

1. Build the Android app (see FCM_SETUP.txt for code)
2. Add the google-services.json file to your Android app
3. Run the app on your phone
4. The app will display your FCM token
5. Copy this token (this is FCM_DEVICE_TOKEN)

QUICK CHECKLIST:
-----------------
☐ Download google-services.json
☐ Complete Android app registration
☐ Go to Project Settings (gear icon or "Project Settings" link)
