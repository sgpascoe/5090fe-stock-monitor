FCM V1 API SETUP - UPDATED INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

Firebase now uses V1 API with Service Account (NOT Server Key!)

STEP 1: Get Service Account Key
---------------------------------
1. In Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service accounts tab
2. Click "Generate new private key"
3. Download the JSON file
4. Open the JSON file and copy its ENTIRE contents
5. This is your FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON

STEP 2: Get Project ID
-----------------------
1. In Firebase Console → Project Settings → General tab
2. Copy "Project ID" (e.g., "rtx-stock-alert-12345")
3. This is your FCM_PROJECT_ID

STEP 3: Get Device Token
-------------------------
1. Build Android app (see FCM_SETUP.txt)
2. Run app on your phone
3. Copy the displayed FCM token
4. This is your FCM_DEVICE_TOKEN

STEP 4: Add to GitHub Secrets
------------------------------
Add these THREE secrets:

1. FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON
   - Value: Paste the ENTIRE JSON file contents
   - (The whole JSON as a string)

2. FCM_PROJECT_ID
   - Value: Your project ID (e.g., "rtx-stock-alert-12345")

3. FCM_DEVICE_TOKEN
   - Value: Your device token from the Android app

QUICK SETUP:
------------
1. Go to: Project Settings → Service accounts tab
2. Click "Generate new private key" → Download JSON
3. Copy entire JSON contents → FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON secret
4. Copy Project ID from General tab → FCM_PROJECT_ID secret
5. Get token from Android app → FCM_DEVICE_TOKEN secret

The code now uses Firebase V1 API which is the current standard!
