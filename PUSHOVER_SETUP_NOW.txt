PUSHOVER QUICK SETUP
====================

You have your User Key: uevm87p2unp2x3b7yi1nsgm7xj2w4g ✅

STEP 1: Get API Token
----------------------
1. I opened: https://pushover.net/apps/build
2. Fill in:
   - Name: RTX Stock Monitor (or any name)
   - Description: Stock alerts (optional)
   - Type: Application
   - Click "Create Application"
3. Copy the "API Token/Key" shown
   (This is your PUSHOVER_TOKEN)

STEP 2: Add to GitHub Secrets
-------------------------------
I opened the GitHub Secrets page for you.

Add TWO secrets:

Secret 1:
- Name: PUSHOVER_USER
- Value: uevm87p2unp2x3b7yi1nsgm7xj2w4g

Secret 2:
- Name: PUSHOVER_TOKEN
- Value: [paste the API token from step 1]

STEP 3: Configure Android App
-------------------------------
1. Install Pushover app on your Android phone
2. Settings → Notifications → Pushover:
   - Emergency Priority: ON (bypasses DND!)
   - Sound: Persistent (loudest)
   - Vibration: Maximum
   - Override Do Not Disturb: ON

STEP 4: Test
------------
After adding secrets, test with:
  python test_notifications.py

Or trigger GitHub Actions manually to test!

✅ Pushover will send Emergency Priority alerts that:
   - Bypass Do Not Disturb
   - Repeat every 30 seconds until acknowledged
   - Play sound even on silent mode
   - Wake you up!
